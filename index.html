    <h1>Loops in Python</h1>
    <h3>In Python, **loops** allow you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. There are two main types of loops in Python: **`for` loops** and **`while` loops**. 
</h3>
<div class="div">
<h2>for` loop:</h2>

<h4>The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a block of code for each item in that sequence.
</h4>
<li>Syntax:</li>
<p>
for item in sequence: <br>
    # Code block to execute for each item in the sequence 
</p>

<p>
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] <br>
for fruit in fruits: <br>
    print(fruit) <br> <br>
Output:
apple <br>
banana <br>
cherry <br>
</p>

<h2>`while` loop:</h2>

<h4>The `while` loop repeats as long as a given condition is true. It is generally used when you do not know the number of iterations in advance.
</h4>
<li>Syntax:</li>
<p>
while condition: <br>
    # Code block to execute as long as the condition is true
</p>
<p>
x = 0 <br>
while x < 5: <br>
    print(x) <br>
    x += 1  # Increment x by 1 <br> <br>
Output: <br>
0
1
2
3
4
</p>


<h2>Controlling Loops with `break`, `continue`, and `else`:
</h2>
<li><b>`break`:</b> Exits the loop entirely, even if the loop condition hasn't been met.</li>
<li><b>`continue`:</b> Skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.</li>
<li><b>`else`:</b> Can be used with both `for` and `while` loops. The code inside the `else` block will run when the loop is not terminated by a `break` statement (i.e., when the loop runs to completion).</li>

<p>
for i in range(10): <br>
    if i == 5: <br>
        break  # Exits the loop when i equals 5 <br>
    print(i) <br> <br>

Output: <br>
0
1
2
3
4
</p>

<p>
for i in range(10): <br>
    if i == 5: <br>
        continue  # Skips the iteration when i equals 5 <br>
    print(i) <br> <br>
Output: <br>
0

</p>
<p>
for i in range(5): <br>
    print(i) <br>
else: <br>
    print("Loop finished successfully") <br> <br>
Output: <br>
0

4 <br>
Loop finished successfully
</p>

<p>
x = 0 <br>
while x < 5: <br>
    print(x) <br>
    x += 1 <br>
else: <br>
    print("While loop completed") <br> <br>
Output: <br>
